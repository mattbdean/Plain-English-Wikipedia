##Using

Simply go to any Wikipedia article such as [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigersaurus) with the extension activated, and, provided that the same article exists on [simple.wikipedia.org](https://simple.wikipedia.org), a link will be displayed to that 

**NB** This extension does not run on any non-information articles, e.g. `/wiki/Special:Random` or `/wiki/Portal:Featured_content`. However, it will run on `/wiki/Git_(software)`.
